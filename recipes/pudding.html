    <p>Smooth, creamy, and lightly sweet, this homemade pudding is a timeless dessert that’s as comforting as it is simple. Made with milk, sugar, and a touch of vanilla, it has a silky texture that melts in your mouth. </p>
    <p>Serve it chilled on its own, layered with fresh fruit, or topped with a dollop of whipped cream for a little extra indulgence. Whether as a quick treat or a family favorite, pudding never goes out of style.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Milk</strong>: This recipe starts with two cups of milk heated on the stove.

        <li><strong>Cornstarch</strong>: Three tablespoons of cornstarch thickens the vanilla pudding.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the flavor, but it won’t make the pudding taste salty.</li>
        <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: Of course, you’ll need vanilla extract!</li>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong>: A tablespoon of butter takes the rich vanilla pudding up a notch. </li>
